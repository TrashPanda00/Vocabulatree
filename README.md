## Introduction :detective:

"Vocabulatree" is an Android app that helps language learners keep track of new words to add to their vocabulary. Newly added words can be reviewed at any time along with their pronunciation. The app provided the option to take a quiz every couple of days which counts as progress towards mastering the new words. A point system with achievements along with a visual graphic of a tree growing as you add and master new words helps the user stay focused and makes the language learning process feel rewarding.

## Motivation :star_struck:

My motivation for developing this app is that as I started learning danish I realized it would be invaluable to have a place to note down all the new words I encounter and having easy access to pronunciation. Up until now I had to have a separate notebook and look up each individual word for its pronunciation which proved to be frustrating and I believe this would solve the problem. Also in my opinion having the game aspect of the app which rewards users for learning new words would help me keep focused and practice at a constant rate.
